## Abstract

We propose a novel paradigm of consuming rich web content in a mobile setting (which are often eyes-free), through a predominantly 3D audio interface. Web content, formatted in audio, is streamed via the mobile deviceâ€™s network connection, and placed virtually in a 3D audio space. The user moves in the virtual space, using a variety of human computer interaction (HCI) means, such as voice input, touching, rotating, and shaking the device, as well as hand and head gesturing. We provide applications benefitting from this paradigm of rich mobile 3D audio web consumption. We provide system designs, and a system architecture for mobile 3D audio. Finally, we implement our ideas in a system prototype using the Apple iOS mobile platform.
